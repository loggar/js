// Symbols are skipped by common object inspection features
// As Symbols were designed to avoid collisions, Symbolic properties are skipped in JavaScriptâ€™s most common object-inspection features such as for-in loop. Symbols as property keys are also ignored in Object.keys(obj) and Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj) .

// Also note that Symbol properties of an object are ignored when you use JSON.stringify().
