# Debugging Node.js with VSCode

vscode `Preferences > Settings > node debug > Debug > Node:Auto Attach` set `On`.

Now, go to your Node.js project file, and set some breakpoints by clicking on the left hand side of the file wherever youâ€™d like to see your code stop, and in the **vscode terminal** type node --inspect <FILE NAME>.
