// RxJS has a whole range of operators that helps you control how the events flow through your observables.
// This is how you would allow at most one click per second, with plain JavaScript:
/*
let count = 0;
let rate = 1000;
let lastClick = Date.now() - rate;
document.addEventListener('click', () => {
  if (Date.now() - lastClick >= rate) {
    console.log(`Clicked ${++count} times`);
    lastClick = Date.now();
  }
});
*/

// With RxJS:

import { fromEvent } from "rxjs";
import { throttleTime, scan } from "rxjs/operators";

fromEvent(document, "click")
  .pipe(
    throttleTime(1000),
    scan(count => count + 1, 0)
  )
  .subscribe(count => console.log(`Clicked ${count} times`));
