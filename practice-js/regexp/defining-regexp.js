\u xxxx The Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx; for example, \u0009 is the same as \t
\c X The control character ^ X; for example, \cJ is equivalent to the newline character \n

[...] Any one character between the brackets.
[^...] Any one character not between the brackets.
. Any character except newline or another Unicode line terminator.
\w Any ASCII word character. Equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_].
\W Any character that is not an ASCII word character. Equivalent to [^a-zA-Z0-9_].
\s Any Unicode whitespace character.
\S Any character that is not Unicode whitespace. Note that \w and \S are not the same thing.
\d Any ASCII digit. Equivalent to [0-9].

{ n , m } Match the previous item at least n times but no more than m times.
{ n ,} Match the previous item n or more times.
{ n } Match exactly n occurrences of the previous item.
? Match zero or one occurrences of the previous item. That is, the previous item is optional. Equivalent to {0,1}.
+ Match one or more occurrences of the previous item. Equivalent to {1,}.
* Match zero or more occurrences of the previous item. Equivalent to {0,}.

| Alternation. Match either the subexpression to the left or the subexpression to the right.
(...) Grouping. Group items into a single unit that can be used with *, +, ?, |, and so on. Also remember the characters that match this group for use with later references.
(?:...) Grouping only. Group items into a single unit, but do not remember the characters that match this group.
\n Match the same characters that were matched when group number n was first matched. Groups are subexpressions within (possibly nested) parentheses. Group numbers are assigned by counting left parentheses from left to right. Groups formed with (?: are not numbered.

^ Match the beginning of the string and, in multiline searches, the beginning of a line.
$ Match the end of the string and, in multiline searches, the end of a line.
\b Match a word boundary. That is, match the position between a \w character and a \W character or between a
\w character and the beginning or end of a string. (Note, however, that [\b] matches backspace.)
\B Match a position that is not a word boundary.
(?= p ) A positive lookahead assertion. Require that the following characters match the pattern p, but do not include those characters in the match.
(?! p ) A negative lookahead assertion. Require that the following characters do not match the pattern p.

[Flags]
i Perform case-insensitive matching.
g Perform a global matchâ€”that is, find all matches rather than stopping after the first match.
m Multiline mode. ^ matches beginning of line or beginning of string, and $ matches end of line or end of string.
