/*
Request is a simplified HTTP client comparable to Pythonâ€™s requests library.
This library is much more user friendly than the default http module and has been considered a go-to for the community for several years.

Its a fantastic option if you just want an easy to use library that deals with HTTP requests in a sane way.
If you want to use Promises, you can check out the request-promise library.
