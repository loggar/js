// Array.some() is similar to Array.includes(), but instead of just taking in an array, it takes in both an array and the value or function to evaluate the items in the array against.
// It will iterate through an array and return true or false based on if it finds what itâ€™s looking for.
// Also like Array.includes(), Array.some() will end its iteration as soon as it finds a value that will return true.
