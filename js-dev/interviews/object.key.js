const a = {},
  b = { c: 'b' },
  c = { b: 'c' };

a[b] = 111;
a[c] = 333;

console.log(a[b]);

/*
This will print out 333, not 111. When setting an object property, JavaScript will implicitly stringify the parameter value.
In this case, since b and c are both objects, they will both be converted to "[object Object]".
As a result, a[b] anda[c] are both equivalent to a["[object Object]"] and can be used interchangeably.
Thus, setting or referencing a[c] is precisely the same as setting or referencing a[b].
